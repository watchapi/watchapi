**Project vision:**

1. **Local-first, no signup required**  
   Works fully offline. Start immediately, stay local forever if you want. No lock-in.

2. **TypeScript & schema-focused**  
   Built for TS projects and schema-driven backends.

3. **Code-native workflow**  
   Manage endpoints directly in your editor. No separate GUI tool.

4. **Framework-specific optimization**  
   Primary focus: NestJS, Next.js, tRPC. Best results when following standard framework patterns.

5. **Correctness over coverage**  
   Returns nothing when uncertain. Wrong output is a bug. Uses deterministic AST parsing, not guessing.

6. **User intent always wins**  
   Code is the template. Your overrides are final. All output traces back to source code.

7. **Incremental adoption**  
   Works with a single file or route. Doesn't require full project conformity.

8. **Minimal learning curve**  
   Start with few clicks. Learn while using, not from docs.

9. **Controlled AI usage**  
   AI only for non-destructive tasks. Clearly marked when used.

10. **Cloud features are opt-in**  
    Optional monitoring, alerts, and collaboration. Never required.
