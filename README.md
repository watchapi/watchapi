# watchapi-client README

This is the README for your extension "watchapi-client". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `watchapi.apiUrl`: Base URL for the WatchAPI server (tRPC endpoint is `/api/trpc`).
- `watchapi.apiToken`: Bearer token for authenticated requests.
- `watchapi.organizationId`: Optional org ID header (`x-organization-id`).

Internally the extension exposes a small untyped tRPC client wrapper at `src/core/api-client.ts` that you can use from extension code.

## Commands

- `WatchAPI: Login` (`watchapi.auth.login`): Upgrades the auto-created guest account to a real user by calling `auth.upgradeGuest`, then stores tokens in VS Code Secret Storage.

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.
